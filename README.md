**No Actions** is a client side mod that removes action menu actions. These can be configured in the CBA settings.

<h2>CBA Settings</h2>

**Any changes to the CBA settings requires a game restart for the changes to take effect.**

* Collision lights on & off
* Eject (which ACE3 also offers to disable)
* Engine on & off
* Inventory
* Lights on & off
* Open Backpack
* Picking up weapons
* Rearm
* Reloading Weapons **(Warning: These settings affect vehicles too!!!)**
* and much more

If ACE is loaded, action settings such as for the "Put Mine" action will not be available.
